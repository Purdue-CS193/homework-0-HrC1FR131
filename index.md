# Dhruv's First CS193 Homework

## Things I Love About CS193:

- The course teaches me how to use GitHub.
- So far, the lectures and online instructions have been very easy to understand.
- It only takes up an hour of class time each week.
- There are PSO sessions where students can seek help from the lecturers.
